# idioms_front
## Motivation
Upon finishing a few example projects from my bootcamp classes I decided to apply it to creating a fullstack application that I believe maybe useful to me. Hence, I decided to create an app to practice idioms.

This is the UI for the idioms applications that will be used in conjunction with (idioms_front).\
Functions:
- Idioms for different langauge
- Daily idiom practice

Used in conjunction with idioms_back (https://github.com/richard5zx/idioms_back)
